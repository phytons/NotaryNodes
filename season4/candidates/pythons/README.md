## About me
I grew up as a nerd. But I call it ET mode. 

First I was interested in hardware repairing but from time to time center of my interest became Linux administration and crypto world.
I am perfectionist and the security is real important for me. 

I am really new in Komodo world, but I have experience in Linux and mining Verus. 
This crypto world is really exciting and I can see in my future in this. 

And I have 3 siamese cats and I'd like to spend more time with them.
